scisea is committed to building a decentralized scientific research community on the Ether Layer 2, leading to a more decentralized science.

# Our Mission
To build a decentralized science community on ethereum layer2<br />
We have created a decentralized science community platform that allows scientists from all walks of life, from all over the world, to use their decentralized identities (DIDs) to engage in free scientific discussions while having open access to a variety of academic research resources.

# Progress
week1 update: 
This week, as I was busy with my studies, I didn't have much time to devote to specific development, so I created a demo of scisea's homepage website and registered a twitter account for scisea at the same time.
